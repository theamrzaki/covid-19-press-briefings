And when we do that again, we’re going to be very clear with people, we just cannot tolerate at this moment in history, any gatherings. And unfortunately, we have no choice, and the NYPD has no choice but to immediately break them up. They’re dangerous. Even though I know people are trying to deal with a very painful moment. I understand that, it’s not easy for people to give up traditions, especially when they’re in mourning, but it’s just too dangerous. So we’ll go back, tell community leaders we need them to step up, as they have so far. And NYPD will be very aggressive.

And I want to amplify what Chancellor Carranza said yesterday, that there’s been an effort by Department of Education to work with that company to ensure the privacy of our students, to make sure their information could not be accessed wrongly. And the Chancellor and the team at Department of Education do not believe the company has cooperated. And we’re not going to put our students’ privacy, our students’ data at risk.

Again, I consistently talk with Commissioner Shea and other commissioners who are looking at social distancing and compliance. Consistent reports we’re getting is that we see a very good consistent effort from New Yorkers. There’s obviously some areas we’re concerned about. But the overall reality is that people are observing this, but we do need to keep the enforcement efforts strong. The problem with the additional street closures is you have to attach enforcement to them. If you don’t attach enforcement to them, we’re very concerned they become new gathering points. And we do not want to seem to be solving one problem by creating a new one. So right now, keeping the NYPD and other enforcement entities focused where they are is what we believe is the best strategy. Remember, they do have fewer personnel themselves than usual. And that’s why we’re sticking with what we got. We’ll certainly assess as we go along.</p>\n","list index out of range https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/mayor-bill-de-blasio-nyc-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6 in <p>Bill de Blasio (<a href=\"https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/jelI0BwCGMR5n2LZw1F4tgXG34aqkNSoe0jqKHprlyFDEJQyc57vns2rgk9uzl0BVilzNFlfq5gA6AVTrkFfHRQE2YQ?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=1899.28\">31:39</a>)<br/> Right. First of all, we’ve made sure that whenever … And I’ve had this conversation with Commissioner Shea multiple times, and we’ve all been united, our Health Commissioner, Dr. Barbot, we’ve all been united that when the NYPD needs PPs, they get them. It’s a priority in our supply. Second, everyone is learning a new way of being, so the Commissioner has told me there’s been multiple rounds of training officers how to approach each situation, what protection they need. It’s not surprising that people are still getting used to it. It’s a big change, but that training continues. And we want to make sure our officers safe. And certainly the standard for going and telling people that they’re not in compliance, we don’t want to have to give a fine to them. We’ve been very clear, I’ve been clear, Commissioner has been clear, we want to tell people that are doing something out of compliance, to stop it. We want to warn them they’re about to get a fine.</p>\n","list index out of range https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/mayor-bill-de-blasio-nyc-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6 in <p>Bill de Blasio (<a href=\"https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/jelI0BwCGMR5n2LZw1F4tgXG34aqkNSoe0jqKHprlyFDEJQyc57vns2rgk9uzl0BVilzNFlfq5gA6AVTrkFfHRQE2YQ?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=1955.06\">32:35</a>)<br/> There’s been very few situations, Erin, where officers have had to intervene more than a warning. There’s only been a small number of situations even where there’s been a fine. A couple of examples have come up where there was a more aggressive intervention needed, but it’s been very rare.</p>\n","list index out of range https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/mayor-bill-de-blasio-nyc-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6 in <p>Bill de Blasio (<a href=\"https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/jelI0BwCGMR5n2LZw1F4tgXG34aqkNSoe0jqKHprlyFDEJQyc57vns2rgk9uzl0BVilzNFlfq5gA6AVTrkFfHRQE2YQ?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=1970.3\">32:50</a>)<br/> Let’s see if there’s anyone else.

We went over the situation with absentees, but we also went over the return rate, which has gotten very strong. I’m going to say it again. Remember, the vast majority of patrol officers, the NYPD are younger and very healthy people. So to the extent they’d been exposed to the virus, they’re coming back rapidly. They’re coming back after somewhere between a week and two weeks. He’s seeing a steady flow of officer’s returning. And what we hope and pray is that once you get this … No, we don’t want anyone to have it. But once you get it, you’re done and you can continue your life and be immune. So no, we can handle the situation with the very deep bench that the NYPD has now.

As you know, as Commissioner Shea has reported, we’ve seen a decrease in crime, thank God. And we’ve seen a high level of compliance with shelter in place and social distancing. There’s literally no better expert at data that I’ve met in my entire life than Dermot Shea. And I have asked him every single day for the last few weeks, “What are you seeing on compliance?” And with all the capacity NYPD also layered over with everything we’re seeing from 311, Parks Department, everybody, we do not see a major compliance problem. We see some hotspots that we deal with. We see some places where we need to do extra warnings and enforcement. But overall, I think right, what we’re seeing is our law enforcement is doing a great job with their current structure, with their current personnel. We’re getting the results we need. We have more work to do, but we’re getting the results we need. Yes.</p>\n","list index out of range https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/mayor-bill-de-blasio-nyc-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6 in <p>Bill de Blasio (<a href=\"https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/jelI0BwCGMR5n2LZw1F4tgXG34aqkNSoe0jqKHprlyFDEJQyc57vns2rgk9uzl0BVilzNFlfq5gA6AVTrkFfHRQE2YQ?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=2168\">36:08</a>)<br/> It’s going to be a large number of hotels. So, first of all, Van Cortlandt Park, yeah, that’s another example of a field hospital that’s being set up by FEMA. You’re going to see a constant growth. So it will be, again, hotels on the one hand, what I would call big public spaces on the other hand. Sometimes it’ll be a field tent kind of thing in a park. More typically, it will be a big, open public building. We use the example the Billy Jean King Tennis Center that was added a few days ago. We’re looking for any large spaces that we can put a lot of beds in simultaneously.</p>\n","list index out of range https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/mayor-bill-de-blasio-nyc-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6 in <p>Bill de Blasio (<a href=\"https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/jelI0BwCGMR5n2LZw1F4tgXG34aqkNSoe0jqKHprlyFDEJQyc57vns2rgk9uzl0BVilzNFlfq5gA6AVTrkFfHRQE2YQ?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=2202.2\">36:42</a>)<br/> But the hotels, so the city now has at least one hotel up and running for medical use.

We’ve got a lot of hotels up and running for people who need isolation. We’re just going to keep growing that. When all is said and done, I think we’re going to be in 100-plus hotels, in most cases, taking the whole hotel on a lease. But as they start to become medical facilities, we’ll give you updates.

This topic is something that a lot of folks in media want to ask me about. I’m just going to draw a line on this one. We’ll put out updates. When is the time I am telling you the thing that I believe is what New Yorkers need to hear. Do we have the capacity to handle it? Yes. We’ve been working closely with the federal government to make sure we have the capacity. Yes, there will be delays because of the sheer intensity of this crisis. We’re going to try and treat every family with dignity, respect, religious needs of those who are devout, and the focus right now is to try and get through this crisis and obviously also put all of our energy and resources into saving those we can save. So that’s how we’re going to go about it. We will have the capacity for temporary burials. That’s all I’m going to say. All right.

The size of our deficit is much greater than the size of our reserves.The reserves are historically high. I want to remind people that we six; well, nine weeks ago; had announced a $6 billion projected surplus in the state.',\n"," 'Yeah, so the question is an important one. It’s one that we were totally posed [inaudible 00And they have the one ability, we don’t, and that’s the ability to meet this moment where constitution are required to balance budgets, they’re able to invest in the future by borrowing in order to get states and counties and communities back on their feet sooner so that we could begin to pay down those obligations in the future. So 1 trillion was the request that we have been working with Speaker Pelosi’s office on for now many, many weeks anticipating these unemployment numbers and by the way, anticipating the next numbers that will come out in a month that will be very much I think in line with the numbers here in the State of California. And if we don’t have that, we will simply not be able to do justice to the needs of so many that are looking for government now to help support them and soften the blow of this downturn.',\n"," 'Oh my gosh, that industry is noble. It’s an opportunity, an entry point, not an entry point, exit point out of poverty. It’s one of the most entrepreneurial industries in our country. I’ve deep reverence for those entrepreneurs and people that put everything on the line. I talk about that often and so by no stretch was that intended. It’s just a factual statement and it was not a statement to be extrapolated as an indictment, quite the contrary of an industry I deeply respect. We’re trying to do everything we can to accommodate the needs of all industries, including the nail salon industry and make sure that we do in a safe and responsible way. It’s currently in our phase III, again, phase III is not a year away, it’s not six months away, it’s not even three months away. It may not even be more than a month away.We just want to make sure that we have a protocol in place to secure customer safety, employee safety, and allow the businesses to thrive in a way that is sustainable. But factually it is true. That was the first case. There are, and I know everybody watching understands this. There are health and personal privacy obligations that are bigger than any public statements that have to be abided by legal parameters as it relates to that first case. To the extent legally and those health considerations could be made more public, we’ll make them more public.',\n"," 'Yeah. Look, we said this is a fluid process, but there are many, many counties that just on that one indicator, remember there are many different criteria and indicators that must be met and plans, containment plans and the like, that are required to move into that next phase, but on that one indicator alone, there are many, many counties that fall in to that space. Look, we’re going to go into this not blindly, not in a political mindset but very judiciously based upon health and data. That’s what our health folks are saying they need to see.CDC has guidelines that they’ve put out and by the way, a lot that we have taken advantage of in terms of helping us augment our own guidelines. And we’re very grateful to the good work of the CDC in that respect. The larger counties, remember I will say this and hope this was clear and I’ll try to reinforce it, we are moving into phase II together. There’s variations for some counties that can move a little faster, but we are moving through phase II together. And so that criteria, specific criteria you referenced is to move a little faster in the phase II, but we’re still moving through two together nonetheless. And so over the next few weeks, we’ll be making subsequent announcements for the entire State, not just those that meet those more restrictive criteria.',\n"," 'We have dozens and dozens of executive orders we’ve put out, put out a one today on elections, we signed another on a series of smaller items, but meaningful items that we’ll make public this afternoon. We talked about our workers’ comp guidelines that we put out just a few days ago, which are foundational in protecting workforce here in businesses that are starting to reopen. The immunity question is one we’re working with stakeholders, have been for weeks and going back and forth. That one at this moment is not ready for any announcement, but know we are working with stakeholders on scene, if there’s something we can do together. Also, working with legislative leaders in that same space.',\n"," 'Well, since we’re the first state to lift the prioritization of testing beyond the CDC guidelines to people that were asymptomatic in these same facilities, let me take advantage of having Dr. Galli here who led that effort with his testing task force, talk more specifically about where he believes we will be very shortly in terms of that issue.Thank you governor and thank you for the question. We continue to work with our stakeholders, both our industry leaders as well as advocates around what is the right way to get many more people both working and those residents in skilled nursing facilities tested. We recognize that it’s a major priority. The number of individuals who’ve tested positive and go on to be hospitalized out of skilled nursing facilities is higher than in the general community, so it’s obviously intense. Day. one of our response here in California, we have been focused on how to ensure the safety of both workers and residents in skilled nursing facilities. As we’ve increased the availability of testing, we have been working with counties and operators and others of skilled nursing facilities to ensure that testing is made available. That we’ve brought the Optum serve sites to align with certain facilities that need testing, so we will continue to build that.',\n"," 'Yeah, I think that question answers itself. The fact that we could see a surge, what greater mistake could someone make than actually having facilities ready to go on a moment’s notice and saying, “You know what? Let’s pack up. We got this.” Only to find out we don’t and we’re scrambling to save people’s lives. I think we cannot… The answer is we can’t afford not to have the alternative care sites established and make sure that these hospital sites, however one defines them, established. We’ll be thoughtful about how they’re staffed. A lot of these FMS sites, as an example, no real staff. Porterville, Fairview, our supplementing staff, by the way, including USNS personnel that are helping us, one of those sites. The old arena up here, ARCO, in the Sacramento regions, perfect example of that. But, these are important assets that are required in terms of resources if indeed we see a second wave.Just another reminder, we’re not out of the woods yet. The virulence of this disease is real. The prevalence of this disease is universal. You have seen cautionary tales. How often do I have to say this? Around the rest of the world in Singapore, Japan, China, about people moving too quickly saying, “We’ve got this,” open up too many sectors of their economy too quickly, only to pull back and slow down the rate of their recovery. Let’s learn from those examples. Let us, at the same time, celebrate progress. 70% now, this economy with modifications is now opened back up. You’ve seen car dealers construction. You are seeing retail establishments like this begin to reopen with all these modifications. You’re seeing the opportunity for regions and counties to move forward into this next phase.
